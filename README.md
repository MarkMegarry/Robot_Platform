# Robot Platform
 A simple robot platform with the basic components for motion. Designed for easy expansion with additional sensors and peripherals

## Aim
The aim of this project is to design an open source robot to help teach people robotics that is:

1. relatively cheap and easy to build
1. easy to modify, expand and iterate on
1. capable of a variety of tasks

These goals drove design choices such as choosing certain components over others in an effort to keep the build process simple and the barriers to entry low

# Whats in this Repo?
1. STL files for the current version of the robot.  
1. STL files for various sensor mounts and expansions.  
1. Arduino code for simple PWM based movement.  
1. Arduino example code for wall following and line following.  
1. Arduino code for advanced encoder based movement.
